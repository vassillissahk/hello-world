# hello-world

Hi guys! I am Lissa. Apperantly I know nothing about coding. I'm starting to learn it now, thanks to the advice from Jane and the encouragement from my beloved partner and best friend, Royce.

This will be the key to one of my most important career decision. Can't wait to see what's gonna happen in the near future.

So I just created my GitHub account today (2/17/2017). This will be my coding journal.
